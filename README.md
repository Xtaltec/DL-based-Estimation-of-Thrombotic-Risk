# DL-based-Estimation-of-Thrombotic-Risk

This repository contains the implementations from the paper: "Deep Learning Framework for Real-Time Estimation of In-silico Thrombotic Risk Indices in the Left Atrial Appendage".

Each folder contains all the code required to run each of the three models from the paper. Each model can be run with several hyperparameter configurations with a fixed random seed or with k-fold cross validation with a single set of hyperparameters. In the first option the cross product of all provided hyperparameters will be performed to test each possible hyperparameter combination.
